Documentation may not be 100% correct because I built this long before I decided all my code should go on github.
I apologize in advanced.


I used:
-Arduino Duemilanove
-Ethernet shield (the one with a microSD slot)
-A mic with an amp and filter (not discussed here).
-A relay, switched by some smaller equivalent of a relay.
-A light & button on a small circuit board that I pulled off the front panel of an old PC

The small panel of lights/buttons came with a ribbon cable.
Since it already had a cable, I just plugged it in and figured out the pins.
That's why pins 0-7 are used weirdly. But you can safely ignore all these


I had no "debounce" or the like in my circuit, it was just a 1k (or 10k?)
pull-down. In the code I would simply wait after registering a button press.

The light shows whether or not the mic is active.
The button toggles the light on/off, but if you hold it down it will
instead toggle the mic on/off.
The relay was connected to pin 9
